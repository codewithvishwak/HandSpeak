# 🖐️ SignToSpeak

**SignToSpeak** is a web-based application designed to assist individuals with speech disabilities in communicating effectively through **sign language**.  
By utilizing a webcam or touchscreen, users can input sign language gestures, which are then converted into **text** and the text into **speech output**.
